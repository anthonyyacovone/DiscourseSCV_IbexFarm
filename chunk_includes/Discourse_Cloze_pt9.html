Coco_is_an_aquatic_turtle.\" &rarr; ]_Emily nodded. Her lower lip was trembling. &rarr; ]_\"Emily,\" I said gently. \"Is there something you want to tell us\?\" &rarr; ]_Emily started to cry. &rarr; ]_\"I'm sorry. I took Coco. It was me.\" &rarr; ]_\"But why\?\" Caleb asked. &rarr; ]_Emily sniffed. &rarr; ]_\"Because my turtle ran away. On Tuesday, I took Bubbles out to play in my backyard, so he could have some_fun_in_the_sunshine. I thought he was taking a nap so I went inside for a drink of water. I guess turtles can move really fast when_they_want_to,_because_when I came back outside, he was gone. I looked everywhere. I knew I'd get in big trouble when my parents found out. And I missed Bubbles so much. I'm very sorry. I_felt_terrible_this_whole_time.\" &rarr; ]_\"When did you do it\?\" Alex asked. &rarr; ]_\"When I heard Mr. Hornswoggle_was_going_to_be_away from the library all afternoon on Wednesday, I thought it was the answer to all of my troubles. I sneaked away during lunch, taking my cheese stick with me to snack on. I was putting Coco in my backpack when I heard a noise, so I crept behind_one_of_the_bookcases. Megan came in to play with Howard. As soon as she left, I ran right out of there. And that's it. Except Coco is acting funny. He\â€”I mean she\-is not eating the food I'm giving her. She seems really unhappy. And I just want Coco to be okay.\" &rarr; ]_Lyra put her arm around Emily's shoulder. &rarr; ]_\"We'll walk with you to see Mrs. Holmes.\" &rarr; ]_We went with Emily to Mrs. Holmes' office and explained everything. &rarr; ]_Mrs. Holmes called Emily's parents, who said they'd bring Coco back by the_end_of_the_school_day. &rarr; ]_Mrs. Holmes congratulated us on solving the case, and for our reward, she sent us right back to class. &rarr; ]_It was finally the day of my ninth birthday party, and it was super fantastic. &rarr; ]_I wore my silver and pink striped knee socks, a puffy orange skirt, a neon yellow shirt with a green glitter unicorn on it, and a pink feather boa wrapped around my neck. &rarr; ]_All my friends came, and guess what\? &rarr; ]_It turned out my birthday present from Mom was a giant glass aquarium with a note inside from Mr. Hornswoggle. &rarr; ]_When Coco's hatchlings get big enough, I will have two Cagle's Map turtles for my very own. &rarr; ]_And THAT is a pretty good deal. &rarr; ]_The end! &rarr; ]_To continue, press 'Esc'. &rarr;"
