var Story = " Javier shook his head. &rarr; ]_\"I went to the same classes as you did. You can ask Miss Flores. I never asked for a hall pass. After school, I walked to_extended_day_with_Alex. I was_with_him_the_whole_time.\" &rarr; ]_Alex nodded. \"That is true.\" &rarr; ]_\"We'll check_your_alibi_with_Miss_Flores.\" &rarr; ]_\"So, can I go now\?\" &rarr; ]_Javier folded and unfolded his hands in his lap. &rarr; ]_He_kicked_at_the_dirt beneath his swing. &rarr; ]_I narrowed my eyes at him. &rarr; ]_\"If you didn't do it, then how come you're acting so strange\?\" &rarr; ]_Javier took a deep breath, and then he said all in a rush, \"I'm not supposed to tell that Tully's mother came into Claws and Paws to_buy_Tully_a_pet_for her birthday. And I'm not supposed to tell that I helped her and_it\'s_going_to_be_a\-\" &rarr; ]_\"Whoa!\" Lyra_held_up_her_hands. &rarr; ]_\"Don't tell her!\" Alex warned. &rarr; ]_Lyra pulled me away from Javier. &rarr; ]_\"Thank you for your help!\" she called over her shoulder. &rarr; ]_She whispered to me, \"New rule: No talking to Javier until your birthday party, got it\?\" &rarr; ]_I had to promise and pinky swear three times before Lyra let me go. &rarr; ]_Then Miss Flores blew her whistle, so we headed back toward the school. &rarr; ]_\"What now\?\" Caleb asked. &rarr; ]_\"I feel like we're grasping at the straw that broke the camel's back!\" &rarr; ]_\"Me too,\" Alex said. &rarr; ]_\"Is there anyone else who_would_want_a_turtle,_like for a pet\?\" Caleb asked. &rarr; ]_Alex wrinkled his nose, which made his glasses almost slide off. &rarr; ]_\"Well, Emily already has a turtle, and so does Xavier. Abby has a bunny. Carys has that yellow talking parakeet she brought for show and tell last year. I think everybody else has regular pets, like cats and dogs and Guinea pigs.\" &rarr; ]_\"People have pigs for pets\?\" Rocket asked incredulously. &rarr; ]_Alex laughed. \"Well, I think that's possible. But Guinea pigs are little furry rodents. Kind of like hamsters.\" &rarr; ]_Thinking of hamsters made me think of fluffy Howard with his cute pink nose. &rarr; ]_Which made me think of the library, and Coco's empty aquarium. &rarr; ]_And then I smacked my own forehead. &rarr; ]_\"Guys! We've been missing a_critical_piece_of_evidence!\" &rarr; ]_I'd almost completely forgotten about the block of cheese with the bite marks in it, which had probably been left by the turtle snatcher. &rarr; ]_And maybe we could use it to catch him! &rarr; ]_When I woke up on Friday morning, it was pouring rain outside. &rarr; ]_The sky was so dark, I almost crawled back beneath my blankets. &rarr; ]_But I had too much to do today, including solving the turtle snatcher case and bringing Coco home safely. &rarr; ]_When the bus dropped me off at school, I pulled my raincoat's hood over my head and_dashed_through_the_rain. &rarr; ]_Mr. Sleuth held the front door open for me. &rarr; ]_Caleb was standing in the lobby, shaking out his wet hair. &rarr; ]_\"Come on,\" I grabbed his hand. \"We have work to do.\" &rarr; ]_But I didn't get a chance to bring out the cheese evidence until first recess. &rarr; ]_The rain was still_pounding_against_the_roof,_so we went to the gym. Miss Flores started dodgeball, which is usually one of my favorite games. &rarr; ]_Part of being a detective was knowing when you had to be responsible and work. &rarr; ]_Coco was counting on us. &rarr; ]_The Gumshoe Gang sat in a_circle_on_the_stage,_hidden behind the blue stage curtain. &rarr; ]_We passed around the hunk of cheese, examining the bite marks with my magnifying glass. &rarr; ]_\"This is definitely the size of a kid's mouth,\" Alex said. &rarr; ]_\"Look_at_these_marks,\" Lyra said, examining the evidence with the magnifying glass. &rarr; ]_\"You can see the marks of the top and bottom teeth biting all the way through the cheese, except for right_there,_in_the_front.\" &rarr; ]_To continue, press 'Esc'. &rarr;"
